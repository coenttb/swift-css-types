/// The CSS `stroke-linecap` property defines the shape to be used at the end of open subpaths 
/// of SVG elements' unclosed strokes. If present, it overrides the element's stroke-linecap attribute.
///
/// This property applies to any SVG shape that can have unclosed strokes as well as text-content elements,
/// but as an inherited property, it may be applied to elements such as `<g>` and still have the intended
/// effect on descendant elements.
///
/// Example:
/// ```swift
/// .strokeLinecap(.butt)        // stroke-linecap: butt
/// .strokeLinecap(.round)       // stroke-linecap: round
/// .strokeLinecap(.square)      // stroke-linecap: square
/// ```
///
/// - Note: The `butt` value (default) means strokes end exactly at their endpoints, while `round` and
///        `square` values extend the stroke beyond its endpoints by half the stroke width.
///
/// - SeeAlso: [MDN Web Docs on stroke-linecap](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/stroke-linecap)

    case round
