# ``CSS``

A Swift package that provides a strongly-typed domain model of CSS properties and values.

## Overview

The CSS Types package provides type-safe representations of CSS properties, values, and at-rules, enabling compile-time validation of CSS code in Swift applications. This package serves as a foundation for building CSS DSLs and tools that work with CSS in a type-safe manner.
