/// - Only supports a limited set of CSS properties
/// - Can be applied globally or to specific elements
/// - Is triggered by user interaction (text selection)
/// - Overrides the browser's default selection styling
///
/// Supported properties include:
/// - `color`
/// - `background-color`
/// - `text-decoration` and related properties
/// - `text-shadow`
/// - `stroke`, `fill`, and `stroke-width` (for SVG)
