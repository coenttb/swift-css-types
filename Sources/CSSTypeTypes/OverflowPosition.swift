/// The `OverflowPosition` type defines how an alignment subject that is larger than its
/// alignment container will overflow that container. This is used with various alignment
/// properties like `align-content`, `align-items`, `align-self`, etc.
///
/// Example:
/// ```swift
/// .alignItems(.safe, .center)          // align-items: safe center
/// .justifySelf(.unsafe, .end)          // justify-self: unsafe end
/// ```
///
/// - Note: If omitted in CSS, the default overflow alignment is a blend of safe and unsafe.
///
/// - SeeAlso: [MDN Web Docs on overflow-position](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/overflow-position)
